So I currently am finsihing my JavaScript project. I had to keep to the very minimum with regard to this project. Life has been pretty hectic with work and school. Grad school has me writing research papers almost weekly, and discussion posts on a daily. Thank goodness I was able to get these classes online.

On top of that I have been travelling nonstop since the beginning of the year. Its only the nineteenth day and I have travelled to nine different cities.

This project was somewhat harder to focus on unfortunately. I havent been able to give it as much love an attention as I have the other ones. I built a very simple Destination list to keep track of all the places that I have travelled so far with in this year.

It only has two of the CRUD requirements, which were create and update. I plan on adding more to it later. Some of the things I plan on adding is a search option to see if I have already gone to a certain location. I also plan on adding checkboxes, and deleteing options.

Lastly, I plan on adding little "locations," "restaurants," and "notes" for my enteries so that they can have more of an informative feel, rather than just a grocery list of places that I have gone.
