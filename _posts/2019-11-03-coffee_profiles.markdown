WOW. Here we are again. PROJECT NUMBER 2! Or as my boyfriend calls it, "The Social Repellant," because I dont wanna go out and do anything until the project is done.

I can honestly say nothing has ever stressed me out as much as this project. Haha. 
This project coupled with my research paper on Personality Psychology really killed me this week. Haha. #YayGradSchool

Where do I begin? Haha. I made a lot of very simple errors in this project. I actually started this project over four different times because it was that bad. I was having some stupid bad luck with my ActiveRecord stuff. 

Luckily I was able to solve my coding issues. Shout out to my Rubber Duckies.

The biggest isssue I had was programming the feature that allows users to edit their posts and only their posts. I can say I spent more than four hours tryin to figure out why User#1 was able to edit their post. While User#2 was also able to edit User#1's posts. COOKIES. Basically when I loggedout as User#1, the program did not fully log out User#1. It stored their info and kept them log in so when User#2 had their turn to edit their post's, they were also able to edit User#1. Confusing. I know. Gave me a headache too. Once I reset everything, User#2 was no longer able to edit User#1. Amazing right? Why did I not think of that sooner? 

There were other issues too but they were simple typos or reassigning variables when they were not supposed to be reassigned. Haha. Duh moments. My rubber duck really helped me keep my sanity. We talked for hours about my code. My take away from this is, if you dont have yourself a rubber ducky, get one. Hatchi, Georgie, and I really pulled it together and saved this code. Haha.

There are a couple of things I have left to do with this project- once I get the skillset to accomplish it. I need to go back and figure out how to get the posts to display and whatnot. I am gonna work on that this week.

So until the next social repellant, try not to spill the booleans. #TryinToComeUpWithACatchPhraseIsHard
