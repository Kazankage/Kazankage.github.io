I started my rails project while watching this show called *Shokugeki no Soma* which is an anime about a guy that comes from a Japanese diner to attending the countries most established culinary institute. 

I was watching on this app called crunchy roll, and it got me thinking about manga and anime. A lot of my friends watch and read and are always asking me, "Have you read this?" or "Have you watched that?" Usually my answer is no. As much as I would like to, I just do not have enought time to get addicted to new shows or books. Too much work and school work to get done during the week. Haha. On the off chance that I do follow a recommendation that a friend has given me.. It is sometimes not worth the excitement.

That is where this rails app project comes in. I decided to do a manga review app. I give you *Munchy Roll.* Munchy Roll allows the user to add manga to their personal collection or the munchy roll collection, and they can leave reviews on the manga that they themselves have read. 

It is a very simple web application that also allows the user to edit and delete their own manga and reviews, while protecting the manga and reviews of other users. 

I had to start the app over three times because the bootstrap theme that I was going to use blocked a lot of the functionalities that I wanted for example, liking "application.css" to the "layouts/application.html.erb," and there were also some glitches that couldnt be fixed. So I had to scrap the project and start over. Thankfully after doing it several times, I somewhat got the clue on how things were suppposed to run, and have the final product. I am pretty pleased with how this turned out, and and debating about adding profile pictures or even a search bar, but we shall see. Also, fun fact, this project actually made me realize how much of an auditory learner I am. 

Eventually I woud like to create or even improve the actual crunchy roll app because the user experience isn't the best. #Goals
