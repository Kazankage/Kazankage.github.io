Project number 3. Just finished for the most part. Just have a lot of it to clean before its completely finished. Basically the point of the app is to read and write reviews about cookies. You can pick out a cookie from the list of cookies provided, or you can create your own cookie, and write a review for it. It has some checks so that a user cannot make more than one post for the same cookie and brand. It will pop up with an error message.

This project was pretty fun. Was not as stressed out as last project. Theres a lot of crazy similarities to coding that I have noticed to life. For example, coding at times was stressful. Life at times is stressful. Coding is fun most of the times. Life is fun most of the time. Haha. Jk. 

In all seriousness, this project was an eye opener for other things that I can possibly do with coding. Cannot wait to get into JSon et al later downt the line.
